the chances of you getting hit by a truck is as high as you getting killed
you might be subjected to intense trails of perseverance where your insomnia will be taken into consideration
you may be blessed by an event of fortune that will be followed by your immediate death
the odds of you actually getting a job is less than Hitler growing a beard
there is a high chance that you will get pelted on the way to the toilet
you will get mugged by 6 year olds
you will forget an essential piece of clothing that might invoke a unprecedented event that will topple your existence
you will die of sneezing
you might get shot through your nosecanals
you will win a lottery for 1000 V-Bucks
you have been dead since yesterday
you will be diagonized of skill issues
